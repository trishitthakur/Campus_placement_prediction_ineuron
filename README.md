# Objective 🎯
The placement of students plays a crucial role in the success and reputation of educational institutions. A strong placement department is essential for attracting yearly admissions and enhancing the institution as a whole. By focusing on improving student placements, institutions can positively impact both students and the institution itself. A successful placement department can help students secure job opportunities, internships, or further education, contributing to their career growth and overall success. Moreover, high placement rates reflect positively on the institution's reputation, attracting more prospective students. Therefore, investing in and strengthening the placement department is vital for educational institutions to ensure their students' success and overall growth.

# Problem Statement ❓
Develop an ML model that accurately predicts whether a student will get placed or not based on their academic performance, skills, and other relevant factors. The model aims to assist educational institutions in identifying at-risk students who may require additional support and improve their placement rates by providing early intervention strategies.
